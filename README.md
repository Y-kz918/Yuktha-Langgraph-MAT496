# MODULE 1  
**video** 1- The video describes how traditional language model workflows, known as chains, are dependable but tend to be too fixed in structure. LangGraph was developed to add more flexibility, giving developers the ability to set the stable parts of a process while allowing the language model to make dynamic decisions. This makes it easier to create AI agents that are both intelligent and adaptable.  
**video** 2- Video 2- Learnt how to create simple graphs in LangGraph, which consists defining states, nodes, conditional edges, constructing graph, visualizing it and graph invocation.  
Changes made: Added "My Examples" section towards the end where I implemented my own graph example.
